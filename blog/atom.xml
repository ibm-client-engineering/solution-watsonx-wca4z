<li>The team made contact with the client and they said that they think they have resolved things on their side that should allow outbound connectivity to the DB.</li>
<li>Another one of the clients local machines was experiencing the same <code>Cannot connect Mainframe Projects service (URL is null)! Please check settings from CCS</code> error that we troubleshooted in a previous session</li>
<li>After further conversation with the client, they discovered that the machine that was encountering this error had multiple Java versions and JAVA_HOME was not set. After setting the correct Java and clearing the cache they were able to see the list of projects in IDZ.</li>
<li>The team is continuing to work with support to resolve Case TS015519419. Recent feedback on the ticket suggested collecting logs from Podman ad-core-server, refactoring-assistant, and refactoring-assistant-u if the client encounters this issue again.</li>

<li>The team had a trouble shooting session with the client (2/22/24). The focus of this session was to resolve the issue of graphs not populating in IBM Developer for Z (IDZ) and to resolve connecting from a client's local machine to IDZ.</li>
<li>After some investigation, the team discovered that the port needed for the OrientDB connection was being used by another java process. Once that other java process was stopped and the graphDB service started, the graphs began to populate in the client's IDZ.</li>
<li>Next the team moved to resolve connecting the client's local machine to IDZ. After some troubleshooting the team identified the issue was the keystore. IDZ has its own java environment and the issue was resolved by adding the keystore to the java environment being used by IDZ. Once the keystore was added the client was able to use IDZ from their local machine.</li>
<li>The team had another session (2/23/24). There was an attempt to reproduce the splicing error, however the client was unable to reproduce it during this session. The team then conversed about the outbound connectivity to the firewall for accessing IBM DB Cloud DB2. The client said they expected this to be resolved by next Monday (2/26/24).</li>
