## Work in Progress

- The team experienced some difficulty using host names instead of IP addresses due to IT issues on clientâ€™s side.
- The problem stemmed from how the client was provisioning system was configured, which did not allow for the use of fully qualified domain names.
- The team opened ticket TS015447064. This issue was resolve by changing priority to IPv4 instead of IPv6.
- The client was having issues related to container management. The team explained using the `stop.sh --all` command ensures that all containers are stopped. And the client was able to restart pods with out issues.
- Inconsistencies and errors were observed in the client's environment, particularly regarding certificate errors.
- The team suspected that these issues were related to the network provisioning for client's systems.
