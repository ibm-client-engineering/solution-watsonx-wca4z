### Firewall Rules

If you plan to install ADDI and RA inside a firewall and connect to DB2 on
IBM Cloud then you need to ensure that there is an available network path
upfront. Even if the system running ADDI has internet access, the firewall
may still block traffic on the DB2 port.

If necessary, open a network security request on the deployment side to 
create a firewall rule to allow this traffic through.

For more technical details, see 
[Connecting to DB2 on Cloud from inside a firewall](Prepare/cloud_databases#connecting-to-db2-on-cloud-from-inside-firewall)

### IP-based Restrictions

Determine if restrictions need to be placed on the services in IBM Cloud
so that only customer IP addresses or ranges can access the services. ensure
that you gather the IP addresses or ranges from the customer up front and 
have that ready after deploying the IBM Cloud components.

The mechanisms to do this with-in a TechZone managed IBM Cloud account (Velocity) 
are available in varying degrees or not at all, so it's easiest if this
is not required. If it is required, the following are some relevant notes
on the different services.

1. Cloud Object Storage (COS) – We are able to [leverage context-based 
restrictions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-tutorial)
to secure the COS service. Once we have the IP ranges 
to use it’s a matter of plugging those in and creating a rule to access that service
2. DB2 on Cloud – We are able to use [allowlists](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-allowlisting&interface=ui#ip-allowlist)
to limit IP connections to the deployment.
3. WatsonX Code Assistant for Z – WCAz uses a multitenant SaaS service 
where connections are made through a single global endpoint. Because the SaaS service 
uses a single global endpoint, it isn’t possible to restrict IP access to the WCAz service. 
However, the WCAz component is completely transient and does not hold any data at rest. 
The metadata from the refactored code is held in the DB2 on Cloud instance and that 
will be protected by IP restrictions.
