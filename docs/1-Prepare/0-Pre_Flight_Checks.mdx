### Firewall Rules

If you plan to install ADDI and RA inside a firewall and connect to DB2 on
IBM Cloud then you need to ensure that there is an available network path
upfront. Even if the system running ADDI has internet access, the firewall
may still block traffic on the DB2 port.

If necessary, open a network security request on the deployment side to 
create a firewall rule to allow this traffic through.

For more technical details, see 
[Connecting to DB2 on Cloud from inside a firewall](Prepare/cloud_databases#connecting-to-db2-on-cloud-from-inside-firewall)

### IP-based Restrictions

Determine if restrictions need to be placed on the services in IBM Cloud
so that only customer IP addresses or ranges can access the services. ensure
that you gather the IP addresses or ranges from the customer up front and 
have that ready after deploying the IBM Cloud components.

The mechanisms to do this with-in a TechZone managed IBM Cloud account (Velocity) 
are available in varying degrees or not at all, so it's easiest if this
is not required. If it is required, the following are some relevant notes
on the different services.

1. Cloud Object Storage (COS) – We are able to [leverage context-based 
restrictions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-tutorial)
to secure the COS service. Once we have the IP ranges 
to use it’s a matter of plugging those in and creating a rule to access that service
2. DB2 on Cloud – We are able to use [allowlists](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-allowlisting&interface=ui#ip-allowlist)
to limit IP connections to the deployment.
3. WatsonX Code Assistant for Z – WCAz uses a multitenant SaaS service 
where connections are made through a single global endpoint. Because the SaaS service 
uses a single global endpoint, it isn’t possible to restrict IP access to the WCAz service. 
However, the WCAz component is completely transient and does not hold any data at rest. 
The metadata from the refactored code is held in the DB2 on Cloud instance and that 
will be protected by IP restrictions.

### Multiple COBOL Programs in Pilot

As of March 2024, a WCAz space/deployment has a single connection to DB2 on Cloud and that
DB2 on Cloud can only contain one project build. If a customer wants to do transformation
on more than one project there are two options.

1. Serial - Do the first application end to end, then do the second application. This is the simplest
way to do it and it is recommended to pursue this path.

2. At the same time - In order to handle two application projects at the same time, you will need
to duplicate a lot of things. You will need to duplicate DB2, Cloud Object Storage, have a second
WCAz space/deployment hooked up to those duplicate services. You will have to configure the ADDI
and RA environment to use the 2 different cloud service groups. And lastly, you will need two 
separate VSCode instances using the two different API keys.

### Installing SQL Server on same system as ADDI

Some customers may have policies against installing databases on the same system as other applications.
If this is the case you will need an extra Windows server in your architecture to house the SQL Server.
