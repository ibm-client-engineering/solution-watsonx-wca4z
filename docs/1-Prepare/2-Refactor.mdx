:::note
This guide assumes you have an IBM Cloud account that is accessible. It also assumes you have the `ibmcloud` cli installed and configured. The installation of `ibmcloud` cli can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli). 

Mileage may vary on different cloud providers.
:::

## Pre-Requisites

- Watsonx Code Assistant instance deployed in IBM Cloud
- IBM® Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI)
- IBM Application Discovery Connect for Mainframe (IBM AD Connect for Mainframe)

## Hardware

For this build, we will be deploying a Linux Virtual Server Instance in IBM Cloud. It require the following:

Refactor Host
- OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8x/9x
- RAM: 16G
- Storage: 100G for local, 400G for data
- Cores: 4

## Software to be installed

:::info
As of this writing, RA version 1.1.1 is available and can be downloaded from [IBM Software Downloads](https://w3south-limited-use.cpc.ibm.com/software/xl/download/ticket.wss)
:::

Refactoring Assistant
- Podman
- Refactor Containers

## Refactor Host

### Creating the instance in IBM Cloud

Install the ibmcloud plugin for infrastructure service

_note to RK: Add the cli commands to create the instance here_

:::note
When you create your RHEL instance, make sure you created it with your SSH key installed.
:::

Make sure to add an external floating ip to your RHEL instance in IBM Cloud. This will allow us to SSH in using our SSH key.

### Accessing the instance in IBM Cloud

```tsx
ibmcloud plugin install infrastructure-service
```
Our instance name for RHEL 9.x is called "wca4z-refactor"

### Configure the data disk

On our IBM Cloud VSI RHEL9 host, we aren't using anything fancy like LVM2. So we're going to just spin this out as a regular disk and hang it on.

1. Find the disk

```tsx
[root@wca4z-refactor ~]# lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
vda    252:0    0  100G  0 disk
├─vda1 252:1    0    1M  0 part
├─vda2 252:2    0  200M  0 part /boot/efi
├─vda3 252:3    0  500M  0 part /boot
                                /
    // highlight-start
vdb    252:16   0  500G  0 disk
    // highlight-end
vdc    252:32   0  392K  0 disk
vdd    252:48   0   44K  0 disk
```

Create the primary partition on the new disk

:::note
This assumes the customer is using XFS as their filesystem for their RHEL host. Mileage may vary.
:::

```tsx
parted -s -a optimal /dev/vdb mklabel gpt 'mkpart primary xfs 1 -1'

mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1

```

Create the necessary directory path. We want to mount all our podman storage on the data filesystem we just created
```tsx
mkdir -p /var/lib/containers/storage

echo "/dev/vdb1	/var/lib/containers/storage xfs	defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

mount -a
```

You should now see the new filesystem mounted.

```tsx
df -h

[root@wca4z-refactor containers]# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs        4.0M     0  4.0M   0% /dev
tmpfs           7.9G   84K  7.9G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs           3.2G  351M  2.8G  11% /run
/dev/vda4       100G   11G   89G  11% /
/dev/vda3       495M  247M  249M  50% /boot
/dev/vda2       200M  7.0M  193M   4% /boot/efi
tmpfs           1.6G     0  1.6G   0% /run/user/0
/dev/vdb1       500G  5.6G  495G   2% /var/lib/containers/storage
```

### Install pre-req packages

```tsx
sudo dnf -y install podman unzip wget java-11-openjdk.x86_64 httpd-tools
```

Enable podman and start it up.

```tsx
sudo systemctl start podman
sudo systemctl enable podman

```

### Retrieve and install the Refactor Assistant

Go to IBM's internal download [site](https://w3south-limited-use.cpc.ibm.com/software/xl/download/ticket.wss) and download `IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z Refactoring Assistant 1.1.1 Linux Multilingual`.


We are extracting this package to the root directory. 

```tsx

:::info
More installation info can be found here.

https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-code-assistant-4z/1.0?topic=installing-setting-up
:::

In your IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z Refactoring Assistant root directory, run the following command to install the IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z Refactoring Assistant container images.


```plaintext-ibm
cd ~/refactoring-assistant
./setup.sh
```

Copy the `config/template.properties` file to `config/config.properties`. Open `config/config.properties` in an editor and enter the values inside as instructed. You can refer to the following example:

Important values here are:

- `CERTS_LOCATION` will be created if it doesn't exist when we run the start command. We are using `/root/certs` in our environment.
- `AD_HOST_PORT` this is the ip or FQDN of the ADDI host.
- `ENVIRONMENT_ID` can be obtained from the ADDI dashboard on the ADDI Host.

### Generate the TLS Certs for Refactor

Generate the TLS certs that will be required for ADDI Host and Refactor host to talk to each other.

```tsx
./start.sh --prepare-only /root/certs
```

This will generate a bunch of certs in that directory.

In the `/root/certs` directory, a self-signed certificate named `root.crt` is generated from the preparatory step. Copy this certificate to the IBM ADDI host where IBM AD Configuration Server is running, and import it into the `truststore` file that ADDI uses.

In our case it was just easier to create the `root.crt` file and copy the contents over.



now let's start things up

### Start up Refactor

```tsx
./start.sh
```

:::info
Once the start command is run, you will be asked what image registry to download the `orientdb` container image from. We've selected the `docker.io` repo in this example.
:::

Set the orientdb pass to `inittest`

Once things are happier, podman should show the following:
```tsx
[root@wca4z-refactor refactoring-assistant]# podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                            COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS             PORTS                   NAMES
2e6843cce881  docker.io/library/orientdb:3.2.18                /orientdb/bin/ser...  About a minute ago  Up About a minute                          orientdb
bc5bbd4219b0  localhost/ibm/ra/ad-core-server:1.1.1                                  53 seconds ago      Up 52 seconds      0.0.0.0:4001->4001/tcp  ad-core-server
b9973f5940c4  localhost/ibm/ra/refactoring-assistant:1.1.1                           52 seconds ago      Up 50 seconds      0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp  refactoring-assistant
c9071da1e3b5  localhost/ibm/ra/refactoring-assistant-ui:1.1.1  /bin/sh -c nginx ...  50 seconds ago      Up 48 seconds      0.0.0.0:9443->9080/tcp  refactoring-assistant-ui
```

Let's set refactor as a systemd service. The service script will ask you for the orientdb password, which we set to `inittest`.

```tsx
./install-as-service.sh
```

This will configure the services as a systemd service that will start on reboots.
