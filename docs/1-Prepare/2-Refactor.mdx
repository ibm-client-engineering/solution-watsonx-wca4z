:::note
This guide assumes you have an IBM Cloud account that is accessible. It also assumes you have the `ibmcloud` cli installed and configured. The installation of `ibmcloud` cli can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli). 

Mileage may vary on different cloud providers.
:::

Refactor Host
- OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8x/9x
- RAM: 16G
- Storage: 100G for local, 400G for data
- Cores: 4

## Software to be installed

Refactoring Assistant
- Podman
- Refactor Containers

## Refactor Host

### Creating the instance in IBM Cloud

Install the ibmcloud plugin for infrastructure service

_note to RK: Add the cli commands to create the instance here_

:::note
When you create your RHEL instance, make sure you created it with your SSH key installed.
:::

Make sure to add an external floating ip to your RHEL instance in IBM Cloud. This will allow us to SSH in using our SSH key.

### Accessing the instance in IBM Cloud

```tsx
ibmcloud plugin install infrastructure-service
```
Our instance name for RHEL 9.x is called "wca4z-refactor"

### Configure the data disk

On our IBM Cloud VSI RHEL9 host, we aren't using anything fancy like LVM2. So we're going to just spin this out as a regular disk and hang it on.

1. Find the disk

```tsx
[root@wca4z-refactor ~]# lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
vda    252:0    0  100G  0 disk
├─vda1 252:1    0    1M  0 part
├─vda2 252:2    0  200M  0 part /boot/efi
├─vda3 252:3    0  500M  0 part /boot
                                /
    // highlight-start
vdb    252:16   0  500G  0 disk
    // highlight-end
vdc    252:32   0  392K  0 disk
vdd    252:48   0   44K  0 disk
```

Create the primary partition on the new disk

:::note
This assumes the customer is using XFS as their filesystem for their RHEL host. Mileage may vary.
:::

```tsx
parted -s -a optimal /dev/vdb mklabel gpt 'mkpart primary xfs 1 -1'

mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1

```

Create the necessary directory path. We want to mount all our podman storage on the data filesystem we just created
```tsx
mkdir -p /var/lib/containers/storage

echo "/dev/vdb1	/var/lib/containers/storage xfs	defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

mount -a
```

You should now see the new filesystem mounted.

```tsx
df -h

[root@wca4z-refactor containers]# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs        4.0M     0  4.0M   0% /dev
tmpfs           7.9G   84K  7.9G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs           3.2G  351M  2.8G  11% /run
/dev/vda4       100G   11G   89G  11% /
/dev/vda3       495M  247M  249M  50% /boot
/dev/vda2       200M  7.0M  193M   4% /boot/efi
tmpfs           1.6G     0  1.6G   0% /run/user/0
/dev/vdb1       500G  5.6G  495G   2% /var/lib/containers/storage
```

### Install pre-req packages

```tsx
sudo dnf -y install podman unzip wget java-11-openjdk.x86_64
```

Enable podman and start it up.

```tsx
sudo systemctl start podman
sudo systemctl enable podman

```

:::

In your IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z Refactoring Assistant root directory, run the following command to install the IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z Refactoring Assistant container images.


```plaintext-ibm
cd ~/refactoring-assistant
./setup.sh
```

Copy the `config/template.properties` file to `config/config.properties`. Open `config/config.properties` in an editor and enter the values inside as instructed. You can refer to the following example:

Important values here are:

- `CERTS_LOCATION` will be created if it doesn't exist when we run the start command. We are using `/root/certs` in our environment.
- `AD_HOST_PORT` this is the ip or FQDN of the ADDI host.
- `ENVIRONMENT_ID` can be obtained from the ADDI dashboard on the ADDI Host.

```

Generate the TLS certs that will be required for ADDI Host and Refactor host to talk to each other.

```tsx
./start.sh --prepare-only /root/certs
```

This will generate a bunch of certs in that directory.

In the `/root/certs` directory, a self-signed certificate named `root.crt` is generated from the preparatory step. Copy this certificate to the IBM ADDI host where IBM AD Configuration Server is running, and import it into the `truststore` file that ADDI uses.

In our case it was just easier to create the `root.crt` file and copy the contents over.

### Configuring Certs

Log back into the ADDI host.

If you've followed the steps [here](ADDI#tls-certs-and-keystores), you should have the following files in `C:\certificates` on the ADDI host.

![ADDI_HOST](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-watsonx-ca4z/assets/102995992/e244991c-fe4e-4982-9ed9-ec55019180b2)

Create a new file called `root.crt` in the `C:\certificates` directory and past the contents in from `/root/certs/root.crt`.

Now import the certificate by running the following command in powershell:
    
```powershell
keytool -importcert -alias ad-core-server -keystore "C:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -storetype PKCS12 -storepass "p@ssw0rd" -file "C:\certificates\root.crt" -storepass p@ssw0rd -ext BasicConstraints:critical=ca:true -ext san=dns:10.241.64.4
```
    
Restart the IBM Application Discovery Configuration Service.

The root CA certificate or the self-signed certificate must be installed into the local machine's trusted root certificate authorities. These certs should be the `server_certificate.crt` and `root.crt`. Also the DB2 SSL cert if you received one. These certs should all be in the `C:\certificates` directory since that's where we've been putting them.
- On Windows:
    1. Right-click the certificate and then click Install Certificate.
    2. Select Local Machine and click Next.
    3. Select Place all certificates in the following store.
    4. Click Browse... and select Trusted Root Certificate Authorities.
    5. Click OK and then Next.
    6. Click Finish to complete the certificate import wizard.

### Import the certificate to Java runtime keystore

To import the certificate to Java runtime keystore, complete the following steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt (on Windows) or a Terminal (on Linux) and go to the folder containing the newly prepared `server_keystore.p12`. This would be `C:\certificates`.
2. Execute the following command to import all certificates from server_keystore.p12 to the Java's cacerts keystore.

Run this in a regular dos shell. Powershell will not have the JAVA_HOME env set correctly.

```dos
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore "C:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -srcstorepass "p@ssw0rd" -destkeystore "%JAVA_HOME%\lib\security\cacerts" -deststorepass "changeit"
        
```
:::info
The default cacerts password is `changeit`.
:::

![ADDI](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-watsonx-ca4z/assets/102995992/5a80ddf9-2b8e-46d1-82b5-bfa48a5fdadb)

WIll probably have to repeat when we have a cert for the db2 instance

From the **ADDI Dashboard**, restart the Configuration service.

https://localhost:9443/ad/admin/dashboard

In powershell on the ADDI host, export the zookeeper.crt from the keystore.

```powershell

keytool -exportcert -alias "10.241.64.4" -keystore "C:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -rfc -file "C:\certificates\zookeeper.crt" -storepass "p@ssw0rd" -ext BasicConstraints:critical=ca:true -ext san=dns:10.241.64.4

```

Create a new file on the Refactor host called `zookeeper.crt` in `/root/certs` and copy/paste the contents over.

Now copy `zookeeper.crt` to `ad.crt` and `dex.crt`.

```bash
cp /root/certs/zookeeper.crt /root/certs/ad.crt
cp /root/certs/zookeeper.crt /root/certs/dex.crt
```

now let's start things up

### Start up Refactor

```tsx
./start.sh
```

:::info
Once the start command is run, you will be asked what image registry to download the `orientdb` container image from. We've selected the `docker.io` repo in this example.
:::

Set the orientdb pass to `inittest`

Once things are happier, podman should show the following:
```tsx
[root@wca4z-refactor refactoring-assistant]# podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                            COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                   NAMES
39ee821934ad  docker.io/library/orientdb:3.2.18                /orientdb/bin/ser...  6 minutes ago  Up 6 minutes                          orientdb
2ea1ed0227ae  localhost/ibm/ra/ad-core-server:1.1.0                                  3 minutes ago  Up 3 minutes  0.0.0.0:4001->4001/tcp  ad-core-server
5728a7c116d4  localhost/ibm/ra/refactoring-assistant:1.1.0                           3 minutes ago  Up 3 minutes  0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp  refactoring-assistant
88c2177e3de6  localhost/ibm/ra/refactoring-assistant-ui:1.1.0  /bin/sh -c nginx ...  3 minutes ago  Up 3 minutes  0.0.0.0:9080->9080/tcp  refactoring-assistant-ui
```

Let's set refactor as a systemd service. The service script will ask you for the orientdb password, which we set to `inittest`.

```tsx
./install-as-service.sh
```

This will configure the services as a systemd service that will start on reboots.
