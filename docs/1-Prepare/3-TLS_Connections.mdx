### TLS Certs and Keystores

The following is a complicated dance between our two hosts, Refactor and ADDI. We need to generate our TLS certs.

Create some keystores for stuff. For real, DEX needs this and we're ultimately going to import our root cert from the refactor assistant into this keystore.

:::warning
As of windows server 2022 and newer, (win11x), the default output from any cmdlet in PowerShell automatically encodes the output as UTF-16E. This causes a problem for the configuration service when it tries to import the certificate chain we will be generating. 

Ref: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_character_encoding?view=powershell-7.4

To set the output encoding correctly, add the following to the PowerShell profile if you can.

```powershell
$PSDefaultParameterValues['Out-File:Encoding'] = 'utf8'
```

Otherwise run that powershell command each time you open a PowerShell instance.

:::

Each server must have a keystore that contains the following entries:

- A `PrivateKeyEntry` of the CA signed certificate.
- A `TrustedCertEntry` of the root CA certificate.

It's apparently optional to generate a self-signed key cert. We're going to generate one as while it's best practices to have a key cert signed by a real CA, we don't have a real CA.

This will be our local keystore.

Make sure that `D:\certificates` exists as this is where we will store these keys.
 
It's best to use the FQDN of your ADDI host if you have one. Ours in this example is `wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com`. However you can also just use the host ip address.

```powershell
keytool -genkeypair -alias "wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com" -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -dname "cn=wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com" -keypass "p@ssw0rd" -keystore "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -storepass "p@ssw0rd" -storetype PKCS12 -ext BasicConstraints:critical=ca:true -ext san=dns:wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com
```

Now we have a keystore sitting at `C:\Users\Administrator.WCA4Z-ADDI\server_keystore.p12`


Let's now export the cert

```powershell
keytool -exportcert -alias "wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com" -keystore "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -file "D:\certificates\server_certificate.crt" -storepass "p@ssw0rd"
```

Now let's re-import the certificate into the keystore under the alias of `self-signed-root`

```powershell
keytool -keystore "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -import -file "D:\certificates\server_certificate.crt" -alias "self-signed-root" -storepass "p@ssw0rd"
```

If you have the DB2 SSL certificate for the cloud instance of DB2, import it into the keystore as well.

```powershell
keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias "DB2-ssl-cert" -file "D:\certificates\DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt" -keystore "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -storepass "p@ssw0rd"
```

In that vein, if you followed the TLS setup [here](Refactor#generate-the-tls-certs-for-refactor), you should have a `root.crt` in `/root/certs`.

Create a new file called `root.crt` in the `D:\certificates` directory on the ADDI host and paste the contents in from `/root/certs/root.crt`.

Now import the certificate by running the following command in powershell:
    
```powershell
keytool -importcert -alias ad-core-server -keystore "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -storetype PKCS12 -storepass "p@ssw0rd" -file "D:\certificates\root.crt" -storepass p@ssw0rd -ext BasicConstraints:critical=ca:true -ext san=dns:wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com
```

Now let's use OpenSSL to generate the `server.key`

Open up Cygwin Terminal App

Use the **OpenSSL** tool from **Cygwin** to export the certificates in a dedicated location. 

To generate the server.key file, run the following command in the Cygwin Terminal App.

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -nocerts -nodes -out "D:\certificates\server.key"
```


### Configuring Certs

Log back into the ADDI host.

If you've followed the above steps, you should have the following files in `D:\certificates` on the ADDI host.

![ADDI_HOST](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-watsonx-ca4z/assets/102995992/e244991c-fe4e-4982-9ed9-ec55019180b2)


Generate the `server_certificate.crt` file again, but _different_ in your Powershell window.

```tsx
$PSDefaultParameterValues['Out-File:Encoding'] = 'utf8'
keytool -list -keystore "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -rfc > "D:\certificates\server_certificate.crt"
```

Open that `server_certificate.crt` in notepad and reset the order of certs. We want the root cert to be at the top.

```tsx
Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 4 entries
//highlight-start
Alias name: wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com
Creation date: Mar 1, 2024
Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
Certificate chain length: 1
Certificate[1]:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<CERT HERE>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
//highlight-end

*******************************************
*******************************************


Alias name: ad-core-server
Creation date: Mar 1, 2024
Entry type: trustedCertEntry

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<CERT HERE>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----


*******************************************
*******************************************


Alias name: db2-ssl-cert
Creation date: Mar 1, 2024
Entry type: trustedCertEntry

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<CERT HERE>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----


*******************************************
*******************************************


Alias name: self-signed-root
Creation date: Mar 1, 2024
Entry type: trustedCertEntry

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<CERT HERE>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----


*******************************************
*******************************************


```
    

The root CA certificate or the self-signed certificate must be installed into the local machine's trusted root certificate authorities. These certs should be the `server_certificate.crt` and `root.crt`. Also the DB2 SSL cert if you received one. These certs should all be in the `C:\certificates` directory since that's where we've been putting them.
- On Windows:
    1. Right-click the certificate and then click Install Certificate.
    2. Select Local Machine and click Next.
    3. Select Place all certificates in the following store.
    4. Click Browse... and select Trusted Root Certificate Authorities.
    5. Click OK and then Next.
    6. Click Finish to complete the certificate import wizard.

### Import the certificate to Java runtime keystore

To import the certificate to Java runtime keystore, complete the following steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt (on Windows) or a Terminal (on Linux) and go to the folder containing the newly prepared `server_keystore.p12`. This would be `C:\certificates`.
2. Execute the following command to import all certificates from server_keystore.p12 to the Java's cacerts keystore.

Run this in a regular dos shell. Powershell will not have the JAVA_HOME env set correctly.

```dos
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -srcstorepass "p@ssw0rd" -destkeystore "%JAVA_HOME%\lib\security\cacerts" -deststorepass "changeit"
        
```
:::info
The default cacerts password is `changeit`.

![ADDI](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-watsonx-ca4z/assets/102995992/5a80ddf9-2b8e-46d1-82b5-bfa48a5fdadb)

WIll probably have to repeat when we have a cert for the db2 instance

From the **ADDI Dashboard**, restart the Configuration service.

https://localhost:9443/ad/admin/dashboard

In powershell on the ADDI host, export the zookeeper.crt from the keystore.

```powershell

keytool -exportcert -alias "wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com" -keystore "D:\certificates\server_keystore.p12" -rfc -file "D:\certificates\zookeeper.crt" -storepass "p@ssw0rd" -ext BasicConstraints:critical=ca:true -ext san=dns:wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com

```
On the RA host, create the `zookeeper.crt` file in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` and copy the contents of `zookeeper.crt` into it.

Then run the following command on the Refactor host

```tsx
update-ca-trust extract
```
Create the following symlinks

```bash
ln -s /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/zookeeper.crt /root/certs/ad.crt
ln -s /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/zookeeper.crt /root/certs/dex.crt
ln -s /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/zookeeper.crt /root/certs/zookeeper.crt
```

### DEX Server configuration

Let's generate a hashed SHA256 password on the linux refactor host

```bash
openssl passwd -5 p@ssw0rd
$5$aPcZ8PYGME9ztCKm$if2XAAOQVnlD4iLDQgq0a5A982LM5Kyg./czg23g647
```

On the ADDI host, copy `D:\certificates\server_certificate.crt` and `D:\certificates\server.key` to `C:\Program Files\IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence\Authentication Server (DEX)\conf`.


We're going update the `dex.yaml` with the following
Now open the `dex.yaml` file in that folder and edit it.

- Our `issuer` should be either the FQDN or the IP of the ADDI host
- The `redirectURIs:` should point to the ip of the Refactor server.
- `staticPasswords.hash` should be the generated SHA256 password from above

```yaml
issuer: https://wca4z2-winaddi.fyre.ibm.com:7600/dex
storage:
  type: sqlite3
  config:
  file: dex.db
frontend:
  theme: addi
web:
  TLSCert: D:\certificates\server_certificate.crt
  TLSKey: D:\certificates\server.key
  https: 0.0.0.0:7600
connectors: []

enablePasswordDB: true
staticClients:
  - id: refactoring-assistant
    redirectURIs:
      - https://9.66.242.37:9443
    name: Refactoring Assistant
    secret: pkce
staticPasswords:
  - email: addi_user@ibm.com
    hash: $5$aPcZ8PYGME9ztCKm$if2XAAOQVnlD4iLDQgq0a5A982LM5Kyg./czg23g647
    username: addi_user
    userID: null
```

Open the admin dashboard and click Configure at the top
https://localhost:9443/ad/admin/dashboard

Click on the Default env

Go to Servers and Security

Select Security from the choices on the left and then select HTTPS as the protocol type

At the bottom go to "Drag and Drop files here..." and upload the following files from `D:\certificates`
- `server_keystore.p12`
- `server_certificate.crt`
- `server.key`

Set the password to `p@ssw0rd`.

Successful import should look like this
![cert import](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/20330/files/21d267db-6649-4407-bc52-823a89fb2918)


Restart the IBM Application Discovery Configuration Service.
