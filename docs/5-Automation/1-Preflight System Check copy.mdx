## Overview
------------------------
This section will walkthrough the automation script (insert link for system_check.sh) to check if the designated system for each install meets the appropriate system harware and software requirements:

- OS: Windows 10 or 11 
- RAM: 32 Gigs
- Storage: 100G for local, 300G for AD components
- Cores: 8

Refactor Host
- OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8x/9x
- RAM: 16G
- Storage: 100G for local, 400G for data
- Cores: 4

## Script Walkthrough

### ADDI Host check Script

:::note
Make sure you are in the ADDI host
:::

Open Powershell as administrator and run to allow the ability to run scripts
```tsx
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
If you do not run as administrator the scope for the execution policy will be limited to that powershell session, and you will need to run this command every time you open a new powershell window. 


Run system check script:
```tsx
cd assets\papercuts\addi
```
```tsx
.\system_check.ps1
```

### Refactor Host check Script
:::note
The preflight system check is included within the Refactor install script (TODO: ADD Link)
:::
