Be sure to complete the install by configuring ADDI through a web browser. If the page does not open automatically while the install script is running, navigate to this URL: https://localhost:9443/ad/admin/setup.


Once ADDI has been installed, the next step is to install refactor on the refactor host, using the environmnent ID and host port from this ADDI host.
