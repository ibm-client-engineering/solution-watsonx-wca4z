### Purpose
The purpose of this guide is to ultimately reduce the time it takes to carry out a Watson Code Assistant install by leveraging a series of different automation scripts. These scripts are developed in a decoupled manner allowing the end user to leverage any script that may be relevant to their needs.

:::note
Different components are dependent on other components for the install.

### Install Components and Scripts
This install will require a windows and RHEL host respectively for the ADDI install components and the Refactor Assistant components. For each host there are scripts to check for the required hardware and check / install the necessary software:
